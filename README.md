# Script-collection
This repository contains a subset of (Linux) scripts that I use frequently and are general enough to be released publicly. Purpose of each script is described below in short.

* [**uniquify-bash-history.sh**](https://github.com/cbhushan/script-collection/blob/master/uniquify-bash-history.sh) - Removes duplicate entries from bash history while preserving their order and retaining the latest dupicate entry. 

* [**randSleepExec.sh**](https://github.com/cbhushan/script-collection/blob/master/randSleepExec.sh) - Sleeps for a random time before executing the passed commands with arguments.
