# Script-collection
This repository contains (a subset) of scripts that I use frequently and are probably general enough for wider use. Purpose of each script is described below in short.

* [**uniquify-bash-history.sh**](https://github.com/cbhushan/script-collection/blob/master/uniquify-bash-history.sh) - Removes duplicate entries from bash history while preserving their order and retaining the latest dupicate entry. 

* [**randSleepExec.sh**](https://github.com/cbhushan/script-collection/blob/master/randSleepExec.sh) - Sleeps for a random time before executing the passed commands with arguments.

* [**GIMP-plugins**](https://github.com/cbhushan/script-collection/tree/master/GIMP-plugins) - Set of plugins I developed while playing around with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to simplify life.
