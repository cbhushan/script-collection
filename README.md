# Script-collection
This repository contains (a subset) of scripts that I use frequently.
Purpose of each folder/script is described below in short. 
In addition, each script should have more information near the top.
Most of these scripts are tested **only** on Debian and Ubuntu distribution with GNU coreutils.

* [**bash-functions.sh**](./bash-functions.sh): Library of useful bash functions. To be sourced by other bash scripts. This also make use of `bashmenot`.

* [**bashmenot**](./bashmenot): Copy of incredible bash library [bashmenot](https://github.com/mietek/bashmenot),  released under BSD 3-Clause License.

* [**general-linux**](./general-linux): General purpose linux bash scripts. These expects bash version >=4.3.30.

* [**GIMP-plugins**](./GIMP-plugins): Set of plugins I developed while playing around with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to simplify life. Tested with Gimp v2.10. 

* [**image**](./image): Scripts for manipulating (camera) image metadata.

* [**video**](./video): Scripts for manipulating videos. These are largely wrappers on top of [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) functionality.
